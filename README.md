## Installation

### Using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) (highly recommended)

Just run the following command in your home folder:
```

If you have any problems/errors check the documentation on [yadm's website](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/docs/getting_started)

### Manually
You can also download the repository yourself and copy the files by hand. This however doesn't automatically download submodules, so you'll have to do that yourself too.
